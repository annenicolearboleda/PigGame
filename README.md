## General info
Welcome to the Github repository for our exciting new game app, The Pig Game! This game app is a thrilling dice rolling game where players aim to reach a final score of 100. Each dice roll adds to the player's temporary score, which can be added to their final score by using the "Hold" button or be continued to increase by rolling the dice some more. But beware, rolling a 1 resets the temporary score to 0.

The game's interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing players to easily navigate through the menus and controls. The controls themselves are intuitive and responsive, making it easy for players to roll the dice and use the "Hold" button to add to their final score.

This Github repository includes all the necessary files and code needed to run the game app. The project is open-source, allowing users to contribute and collaborate with others to improve and expand its functionality.

In conclusion, The Pig Game is an excellent game app that provides a thrilling and addictive experience for players of all skill levels.
